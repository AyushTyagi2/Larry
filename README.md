## 🧠 Architecture & Scalability

Larry is structured around a **simple yet powerful design philosophy**: _“Add a folder, add a feature.”_

- Each task is placed in a modular subdirectory under `tasks/`.
- The main logic routes voice/text input to these modules using basic `if` conditions.
- Want a new feature? Just drop in a new folder in `tasks/` and route to it.
- There is **no tight coupling**, so modules don’t interfere with each other.

 ✅ This makes Larry **extremely scalable** — there's practically no limit to how many features you can add.
