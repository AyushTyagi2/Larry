## üß† Architecture & Scalability

Larry is structured around a **simple yet powerful design philosophy**: _‚ÄúAdd a folder, add a feature.‚Äù_

- Each task is placed in a modular subdirectory under `tasks/`.
- The main logic routes voice/text input to these modules using basic `if` conditions.
- Want a new feature? Just drop in a new folder in `tasks/` and route to it.
- There is **no tight coupling**, so modules don‚Äôt interfere with each other.

> ‚úÖ This makes Larry **extremely scalable** ‚Äî there's practically no limit to how many features you can add.
